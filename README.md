# Social-Media-Addiction
The goal of this project is to investigate how social media usage affects students' mental health, sleep, and daily life. The analysis is based on survey data from high school, undergraduate, and graduate students across various countries.

Potential Analyses
Correlation Studies: Examine associations between daily usage hours and mental‐health score or sleep hours.
Predictive Modeling: Build classifiers to predict relationship conflicts based on usage patterns and platform type.
Clustering: Identify user segments (e.g., “high‐usage high‐stress” vs. “moderate‐usage balanced”) across countries.
